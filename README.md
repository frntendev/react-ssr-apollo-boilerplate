# React Server Side Rendering Using GraphQL and apollo
A baseline for server side rendering for your React application using GraphQL Apollo.
Inspired by https://github.com/manuelbieh/react-ssr-setup

## Getting started
Clone the repo with
```git clone git@github.com:sepehr1313/react-ssr-apollo-boilerplate.git```

Install dependencies with
```npm i```

Run dev mode with
```npm start```

Build for production
```npm build```

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.
